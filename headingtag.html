            God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. As the story progresses, Kratos is revealed to be Ares’ former servant, 
            who had been tricked into killing his own family and is haunted by terrible nightmares. Armed with the Blades of Chaos, a weapon made out of two daggers attached to chains, 
            <b>Kratos</b>rumbles through ancient Athens and other locations on a murderous quest to terminate the rogue god. Action in God of War is viewed from the third person, and 
            advanced movements such as running, jumping, climbing, and swimming are similar to those in the Tomb Raider series, another adventure-game series with strong platform-game 
            characteristics. Some of Kratos’s foes can be killed only by combinations of magic and physical attacks, making combat more reliant on skill. Greek mythology powers the story, 
            so players encounter a myriad of Minotaurs and Hydras.

        <img src="image/pop.jpg" width="1000" height="200">
        <P class="c"> Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is a third-person action-adventure puzzle-platforming video game The game is the fifth main installment in the Prince of Persia series, and the sequel to 2003's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Set seven years after its predecessor, the story follows the Prince as he searches for a way to stop an entity called the Dahaka that is relentlessly pursuing him as punishment for his meddling with the Sands of Time. He travels to the mysterious Island of Time, where he attempts to prevent the Empress of Time from creating the Sands in the first place, hoping this act will appease the Dahaka.
            Gameplay in Warrior Within builds upon that of The Sands of Time, adding new features, specifically, options in combat. The Prince has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to steal his enemies' weapons and throw them. The Prince's repertoire of combat moves has been expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various gory finishing moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from Sands of Time, the Prince also has a new sand power: a circular "wave" of sand that knocks down all surrounding enemies as well as damaging them. s</P>

        <p class="c">
            <b>Call Of Duty</b> is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision. Starting out in 2003,
            it first focused on games set in World War II. The series originally focused on the World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing the first (2003) and second (2005) titles in the series and Treyarch developing the third (2006). Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a new, modern setting, and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare sub-series. The game's legacy also influenced the creation of a remastered version, released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. The sub-series received a reboot with Modern Warfare in 2019, with a sequel released in 2022. Infinity Ward have also developed two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016). Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, World at War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently creating the Black Ops sub-series. Four other entries, Black Ops II (2012), III (2015), 4 (2018), and Cold War (2020) were made, the latter in conjunction with Raven Software. Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles, Advanced Warfare (2014), WWII (2017), and Vanguard (2021).

        <img src="image/mortal komab.jpg" width="2000" height="200">
        <P class="c" >With eleven entries that even includes an alternate second timeline with its own unique characters, the
            story still has fans invested. WIn the Mortal Kombat multiverse, there are different dimensions (or realms). They’re kind of like alternate Earths, but without the parallel universe gimmick. They’re basically different planets completely. You have Earthrealm, which is us, or a world similar enough to ours
            Edenia is kind of a happy fairytale world made of magic and beauty. Outworld is a barbarian world where violence and monsters run rampant. Netherrealm is Hell itself. Seido is the realm of order, though to an extreme, fascist degree. On the other side of the coin is Chaosrealm, where anarchy is a way of life. Then you got a bunch of random worlds like the world of reptile people, the world of vampires, the world of bug people, and so on.
             These realms are looked over by gods for the most part. You have your regular gods, who tend to meddle in man’s affairs in a limited sense, and Elder Gods, who are higher on the power scale and ultimately don’t do much. They rarely ever interfere, even when they really should. Even higher on the scale in importance and power are Titans, who are hidden in the shadows.   
            Realms are able to conquer and actually absorb each other, becoming kind of a jumbled landscape in the process. To keep things civil, the Elder Gods put together a rulebook. Conquering and merging can only be done by invoking Mortal Kombat. Every generation, there will be a fighting tournament held. Whoever wins loses the ability to age until the next one is held. If the invading realm can win ten tournaments in a row, they have the right to take over. 
            Speaking of lack of aging, people in most of the other realms have incredibly long lifespans and live for thousands and thousands of years.
